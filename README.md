<p>This repository contains the code and documentation for the Web-Traffic Monitoring System, a software solution aimed at preventing the misuse of AI-powered tools during computer-based examinations and evaluations. The system ensures exam integrity by monitoring students' web traffic in real-time and detecting any potential access to unauthorized AI tools during exams.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The use of computer-based tests for educational assessments has increased significantly in recent years, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the availability of AI-powered tools, there is a growing concern about maintaining the authenticity of exams and preventing cheating. This project aims to develop a comprehensive solution that allows monitoring of web activities during exams while respecting privacy and upholding exam integrity.</p>

<h2>Architecture Overview</h2>

<p>The system's architecture consists of several components:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Proxy Server:</strong> Responsible for intercepting and redirecting students' web traffic to the monitoring software.</li>
    <li><strong>Web Application:</strong> Provides a real-time monitoring interface for professors to view and analyze students' web traffic during exams.</li>
    <li><strong>Database:</strong> Manages and stores user information, authentication data, and other relevant data.</li>
    <li><strong>Server-side Application:</strong> Handles data processing, authentication, and communication with other components.</li>
    <li><strong>Local Service Application:</strong> Installed on students' computers to securely transmit captured web traffic data to the web application.</li>
</ol>

<h2>SetUp</h2>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Clone the Repository:</strong> Clone this repository to your local machine. <a href="https://github.com/ObinnaTerry/Project-eShield.git"> link </a></li>
    <li><strong>Configure the Database:</strong> Set up the database and configure the connection details in the server-side application.</li>
    <li><strong>Run the Components:</strong> Run the proxy server, web application, and local service application.</li>
